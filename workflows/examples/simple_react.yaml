# Simple ReAct Pattern Example
# This is a minimal workflow to demonstrate the ReAct pattern
#
# Task: Find files containing a specific pattern
# Pattern: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
# Complexity: Beginner
#
# This example shows:
# - Basic ReAct workflow structure
# - Simple tool usage (grep, file_read)
# - Clear success/failure handling
# - Minimal configuration

id: "simple_file_search"
description: "Learn ReAct pattern by searching for code patterns"

steps:
  - name: "search_and_read"
    pattern: "react_1"
    config:
      # Allow up to 5 think-act-observe cycles
      max_iterations: 5

      # Simple tool set: search and read
      tools:
        - grep
        - file_read

      # Clear, focused system prompt
      system_prompt: |
        You are a code search assistant.

        Task: Find files containing the search pattern and show relevant code snippets.

        Instructions:
        1. Use grep to search for the pattern across files
        2. Read the matching files to get context
        3. Present results with:
           - File path
           - Line number
           - Code snippet (a few lines)

        Example output:
        Found in src/main.rs:42
        ```rust
        fn main() {
            println!("Hello, world!");
        }
        ```

    # Simple success/failure handling
    on_success:
      end: true

    on_failure:
      end: true

# Minimal settings
settings:
  max_total_steps: 10
  enable_retries: true
  max_retries: 1

# Usage Example:
# aco workflow execute simple_file_search --input "Find all println! statements"
